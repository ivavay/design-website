            clear to the ones who care to ruminate <br>
            ludicracrous to the ones who are just passersby
              <br>
              <br>
               <br>
               <br>
            will time <br>
            rub away <br>
            the passion and desires<br>
            that once ran wild in my heart<br>
            <br>
             <br>
               <br>
               <br>
            you sung the world into creation <br>
            and orchestrated our heartbeats<br>
            to vibrate <br>
            with your spirit <br>
             <br>
              <br>
              <br> 
               <br>
            scared by the superfluity of my own ideas <br>
            teemingly jealous of those who have already narrowed <br>
            a paucity of possibilities <br>
            early in life <br>
            <br>
            <br>
             <br>
               <br>
            a desire to be understood <br>
            to reveal my vulnerability <br>
            in careful measures <br>
            in order to connect deeper <br> 
             <br>
            <br>
             <br>
               <br>
              your roots are the hidden seeds  <br>
              once planted but forgotten  <br>
              until you’ve searched the world and realized  <br>
              that what you’ve always wished you had  <br>
              was already within you  <br>
              <br>
            <br>
             <br>
               <br>
              love is measured in how much you're willing to sacrifice 
              <br>
            <br>
             <br>
               <br>
              are you afraid of intimacy<br>
              of getting close to your own heart?<br>
              do you hear your heartbeat change, jumping at unexpected intervals<br>
              as you’re getting ready for a date with yourself?<br>
              <br>
               <br>
              when was the last time you truly wrote<br>
              the last time you played with words for words alone?<br>
              have you been so confined by the literary constraints marked by your society<br>
              that you’ve forgotten that they were marked with dry-erased markers <br>
              capable of being changed and being bent? <br>
              words can exist outside of their conventional boundaries. <br>
              in fact, words are the most effective when they’re matched from unexpected places.<br>
              <br>
               <br>
              would you still write <br>
              if there’s no immediate audience?<br>
              would you still write<br>
              if there’s no instantaneous approval?<br>
              <br>
               <br>
              with age, you’ve grown in knowledge <br>
              of literary usage, for validation’s sake and nothing more<br>
              with age, you’ve lost the will of expressing what’s truly on your heart <br>
              untainted and unpolished<br>
              the kind that children spurt out and is either met with a chuckle or an apology to the adults<br>
              with age, you’ve learned that venturing into uncharted territories is a set up for pitfall <br>
              with age, you’ve wrestled with the thought of whether it is morally right and selfish to put yourself first<br>
              when there is so much suffering in the world, so much undistributed wealth <br> 
              with age, you turn to kids<br>
              their unfathomable laughters at everyday things<br>
              and wonder<br>
              is ignorance is truly bliss?
              
              <br> <br> <br> <br>
              he knows the crevices of our hearts. <br> 
              the irritable boulder that lies between <br> 

              our current reality <br> 

              and where we want to be 
               <br> 
              he reveals <br>

              when we silence ourselves <br>
              for silencing a restless heart <br> 

              takes defeat <br> <br>

              an end to ourselves <br> 

              is the beginning of his work in us <br> <br> 

              it is your handiwork that sculpts me <br> 

              an iteration after every setback <br> 

              my final version unknown <br>
