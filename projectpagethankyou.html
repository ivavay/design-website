                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                This is an ongoing project in the <a href ="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/" target ="_blank">Tech4Good lab</a> where we explore how to cultivate an environment where acts of appreciation and gratitude are expressed more. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Initial Concept</h2>
                <p>Initially, this tiny side-hustle lab project was just going to be a website that displays thank you notes from students who want to express their appreciation for speakers that
                  David invites to in his <a href = "https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/courses/tim80l/17-18" target ="_blank">Entrepreneurship and Leadership class</a>. 
                  The way he did it last winter was that he'd collect thank you notes and feedback responses from students through Google Form, populate those json data on some bootstrap tables, and then email each 
                  of the guest speakers soon after with a unique link. Aside from the digital token of gratitude, I also designed a visual brand for a printed card and mug. A lot of the speakers were happy to receive this simple 'cherry-on-top' gesture, and so we thought that it would be fun
                  to explore more of what this project could expand into. </p>
                 <div class="center-block"><p><img src="assets/img/mug-card.jpg" alt="img"></p></div>
                <br>
                <h2>Initial Objective</h2>
                <h3>Primary - Cultivate a culture of expressing deliberate gratefulness among undergraduate students — or general audience members</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Secondary <br>
                    — Provide a way for speakers to answer unresolved questions asked during their visit (class + lunch)
                    <br>
                    — Provide a way for students to access clips mentioned during talks or any additional resources that speakers may want to pass down
                
                </h3>
                <p>It's so easy to say a quick, authentic thank you, yet not many people do it because they <a href = "https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5394dfa6e4b0d7fc44700a04/t/5b9accf888251bd162f4d30f/1536871672114/Kumar+Epley+%282018%29+Undervaluing+gratitude+Psych+Science.pdf" target="_blank">underestimate its value.</a>
                <br>
                  <br>
                <h2>Initial High-Level Needs</h2>
                <p>These were the 3 high-level needs and proposed solutions that I had defined to address pain points after synthesizing students' responses from last year's class. 
                 <h3>Need — Frustration may arouse from not being able to get to all the questions asked due to the class time constraint . Speakers may feel indebted to get to the rest of the questions.
                    <br>
                    Solution — Provide a way for each speaker to quickly respond to questions that students have stated in their thank-you notes
                    <br>
                   <br>
                    Need — Speakers may have more information they want to say to the students or resources to pass down.
                    
                   <br>
                    Solution — Enable channel for speakers to communicate lasting remarks on the overall experience of the visit as a way to respond to the thank-you notes, as well as the ability to drop a doc of aggregated resources for students because a lot of times, prepared clips were cut short or skipped over completely due to the constraint of time.
                    <br>
                   <br>
                    Need — Students’ desire (along with the organizer/moderator) to let speakers know that they are appreciated for their time and insights.
                    <br>
                    Solution — Assist students in writing genuinely written thank you notes</h3>

            <h3>Info Architecture of Speaker + Student Views</h3>
            <p>After defining these high-level needs, I jumped into diagramming the information architecture + hypothetical flow (I hadn't asked for critiques at this point yet so this was all my own guesswork) for the student and speaker view. In 
              creating my info arch, I referenced to this <a href = "https://theblog.adobe.com/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture-for-ux-designers/" target ="_blank">article</a> to help me avoid the 
              use of repeating modules in visualizing the navigation of this first initial concept. I gave more attention to the 'student view' when I was
              crafting this because students were supposed to be our primary users on our platform
               
            <div class="center-block"><p><img src="assets/img/ia.jpg" alt="img"></p></div>
              <br>
             <p>Here are some questions that I had when drafting the architecture and making the first batch of wireframes:
              <div class="center-block"><p><img src="assets/img/qforthankyou.jpg" alt="img"></p></div>
            <br>

             <div class=" center-block">
           
              <div class="about__info col-md-8">
            <h2>Initial Wireframes</h2>
            <p>I personally prefer jumping into Figma right away instead of the conventional method of sketching out low-fidelity boxes on paper 
              because I tend to get very OCD with the proportions and aesthetics of inked lines. I can also get very distracted by my own inconsistent handwriting 
              variations.
              <p>In vectoring up these wireframes, I tried to apply the fine art technique of 'underpainting' by limiting myself to a grey-scale palette 
              to convey flow and emphasis. I wanted to avoid jumping into colors, even if it's just a tint of some hex for a notification dot, and left the wireframes 
              completely monochromatic. 
              <p>Patience, I murmur under my breath. Resist the temptation of colors. The thrill of exploring visual design can come later.

            <h3>Landing + Onboarding</h3>
            <p> For onboarding, I thought about embedding Typeform for the sign-up process to reduce dev's workload. To sign in, manual could be replaced by 
               Gmail authentification.

             <p>11/16/2018 (Fri) - 2:45PM-3:45PM 
              
             <p>Today, we made a pivot in our design direction. Instead of making a ‘thank you’ writing and submission site specifically for David’s future course use, we decided that it would be more interesting to go down the path of  designing a platform that enables organizers to quickly create webpages for hosting speaker series  — or on a broader spectrum, tackling the question of how we could better facilitate productive conversations around societal issues that people care about. I wasn't the one who thought of this idea. David did. I guess I just had always thought that people like designing and building event landing pages from scratch, because of the autonomy and freedom that comes with it. But, I guess time is a constraint in the real world.
